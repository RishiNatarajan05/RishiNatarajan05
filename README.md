## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin, I'm deeply fascinated with intersection of business innovation and technology. The potential of advanced algorithms and platforms to revolutionize industries excites me, as it empowers entrepreneurs and innovators to navigate an ever-evolving marketplace. I'm dedicated to integrating technical solutions into established business frameworks, refining processes, and creating opportunities for meaningful impact. At UT Austin, I am focused on honing my technical skills and using innovative technologies to tackle real-world challenges and drive industrial progress.
